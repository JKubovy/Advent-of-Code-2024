# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024
My first AoC challenge! I decided to try out the tasks in Rust 🦀

## 🎁 What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is an annual coding event where participants solve daily programming puzzles throughout December. Each day brings a new challenge that tests your coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

## ❓Do you want to try it too?
If you want to get involved, check out the [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com) and use my AoC Rust template [Advent-of-Code-Rust-Template](https://github.com/JKubovy/Advent-of-Code-Rust-Template).

## 📌 To create new day project
You need to have installed [cargo-generate](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate)
```bash
cargo install cargo-generate
```
And then just create project from template
```bash
cargo generate --path ./template --name dayXX
```
